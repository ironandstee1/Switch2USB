# Switch2USB

Switch2USB is a currently-in-development Windows application that allows for controller inputs to a Nintendo Switch using an FTDI chip for USB to UART communication and an ATmega32u4 based microcontroller to handle inputs. 

## Software development

There are two aspects of this software development - the windows application and the arduino program. 

### Windows Application (Switch2USB)

#### Features

1. FTDI Chip testing via UART communication
1. Custom message sending over UART
1. Script selection for premade scripts in pokemon and animal crossing switch games
1. Button-mapped controller inputs

#### Software

1. Front end developed in Qt 5.1.4
1. Back end developed in C++
1. Approximately 50% of the code is auto-generated by Qt Designer
1. Back end and windows-specific development includes FTDI communication and static windows library

I don't develop for Linux, but the available source code can probably be modified to be compatible with Linux versions of the FTDI libraries I use. 


#### Planned features

1. Bug free button-mapped controller inputs
1. Custom button durations
1. In-app script writing and execution
1. Input/controller validation
1. Possible IRC integration for Twitch (Twitch plays Switch)

### Arduino Program (modified swemu-plus-plus)

The program used to handle arduino inputs will be a modified version of my [swemu-plus-plus](https://github.com/ironandstee1/swemu-plus-plus) program. 

#### Features

1. Compatibility with all previous scripts written for swemu-plus-plus in a single hex file
1. Modified functions for individual button presses based on UART communication 
1. Line authentication to avoid multi-inputs that could ruin scripts and inputs

## Hardware requirements

1. FTDI232RL chip or similar compatible device 
1. ATmega32u4-based device
1. Two wires to connect the two device

Source code will be uploaded starting this weekend. Stay tuned!
